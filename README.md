- 👋 Hi, I’m @marianavelezmunera, a biology student from Medellín, Colombia. I'm currently on my 8th semester of the biology major in the Universidad de Antioquia.
- 🦠 I’m interested in microbial ecology and genetics, the emphasis of my major has been genetics but I've gradually shifted to ecology and eventually incorporated both areas in my work. 
- 🦇 I’m studying the relationships between multicelular organisms (specially animals), bacteria and habitats. I'm doing so in my bachelor's degree final project, where my main goal is illustrate how changes in habitat can impact the microbial community of bats' gut.
- 💞️ Besides investigation and academia I'm passionated about science comunication, I believe science should be accesible to everybody and that's why I use my social media and other platforms as podcasts to talk about science topics that might be interesting for the general public. I'm always willing to colaborate in projects aiming to the teaching and comunication of science.
