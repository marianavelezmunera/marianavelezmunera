- 👋 Hi, I’m @marianavelezmunera, a biologist from Medellín, Colombia. 
- 🦠 I’m interested in microbial ecology and genetics, the main emphasis of my major was genetics but I gradually shifted to ecology and eventually incorporated both areas in my work. 
- 🌿 I'm currently doing my master's in Biological Sciences with an emphasis in ecology at UNAM in México!
- 🦇 I’m studying the relationships between multicelular organisms, bacteria and habitats. My master's research focuses on ferns' microbiome and it's relationship to elevation and my bachelor's degree final project had the goal of illustrating how changes in habitat can impact the microbial community of bats' gut.
- 💞️ Besides investigation and academia I'm passionated about science comunication, I believe science should be accesible to everybody and that's why I use my social media and other platforms as podcasts to talk about science topics that might be interesting for the general public. I'm always willing to colaborate in projects aiming to the teaching and comunication of science. I have a podcast named Scibits Podcast where I collab with other collegues from other science areas (math, chemistry, physics and astronomy) to talk about topics of each area and science as a whole.
