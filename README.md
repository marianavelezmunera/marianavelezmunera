- 👋 Hi, I’m @marianavelezmunera, a biologist from Medellín, Colombia. 
- 🦠 I’m interested in microbial ecology. 
- 🌿 I got my BSc in Biology at Universidad de Antioquia in Medellín, and my MSc in Biological Sciences (Ecology) at UNAM, Mexico City.
- 🦇 I’ve studied the relationships between multicelular organisms, microorganisms (especially bacteria and fungi) and habitats. My master's research focused on ferns' microbiome and it's relation to elevation and my bachelor's degree final project had the goal of illustrating how changes in habitat can impact the microbial community of bats' gut.
- 💞️ Besides investigation and academia I'm passionated about science comunication, I believe science should be accesible to everybody and that's why I use my social media and other platforms as podcasts to talk about science topics that might be interesting for the general public. I'm always willing to colaborate in projects aiming to the teaching and comunication of science.
